## Package Review

*Please check off boxes as applicable, and elaborate in comments below.
Your review is not limited to these topics, as described in the reviewer
guide*

-   **Briefly describe any working relationship you have (had) with the
    package authors.**
-   [x] As the reviewer I confirm that there are no [conflicts of
    interest](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#coi) for me to
    review this work (if you are unsure whether you are in conflict,
    please speak to your editor *before* starting your review).

#### Documentation

The package includes all the following forms of documentation:

-   [x] **A statement of need:** clearly stating problems the software
    is designed to solve and its target audience in README
-   [x] **Installation instructions:** for the development version of
    package and any non-standard dependencies in README
-   [ ] **Vignette(s):** demonstrating major functionality that runs
    successfully locally
-   [ ] **Function Documentation:** for all exported functions
-   [ ] **Examples:** (that run successfully locally) for all exported
    functions
-   [ ] **Community guidelines:** including contribution guidelines in
    the README or CONTRIBUTING, and DESCRIPTION with `URL`, `BugReports`
    and `Maintainer` (which may be autogenerated via `Authors@R`).

#### Functionality

-   [x] **Installation:** Installation succeeds as documented.
-   [ ] **Functionality:** Any functional claims of the software been
    confirmed.
-   [ ] **Performance:** Any performance claims of the software been
    confirmed.
-   [ ] **Automated tests:** Unit tests cover essential functions of the
    package and a reasonable range of inputs and conditions. All tests
    pass on the local machine.
-   [ ] **Packaging guidelines**: The package conforms to the rOpenSci
    packaging guidelines.

Estimated hours spent reviewing:

-   [ ] Should the author(s) deem it appropriate, I agree to be
    acknowledged as a package reviewer (“rev” role) in the package
    DESCRIPTION file.

### Review Comments

-   README: In the README, the authors use an abbreviation (FAIR). It
    might be good to clarify what is about (Findability, Accessibility,
    Interoperability, and Reusability). Also, for readers that are not
    introduced to the concept of FAIR, what do you think about linking a
    texto to clarify it? Such as
    <https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618> or
    <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>

## Vignette

-   In the
    [vignette](https://frictionlessdata.github.io/frictionless-r/articles/frictionless.html),
    the pipe from `magrittr` is used but it was not loaded. So if
    someone is trying to follow the code in the vignette, there is an
    `could not find function "%>%"` error.

-   Just for the record: When executing `library(frictionless)` there is
    a message saying that
    `The following object is masked from ‘package:usethis’: create_package`.

-   Adding the descriptions to the schema does not seem trivial. There
    is an example with `purrr` package. But the example might be not
    simple to understand if someone is not used to the `purrr` package.

I\`m talking about this piece of code:

``` r
iris_schema <- create_schema(iris)

# Remove description for first field
iris_schema$fields[[1]]$description <- NULL

# Set descriptions for all fields
descriptions <- c(
  "Sepal length in cm.",
  "Sepal width in cm.",
  "Pedal length in cm.",
  "Pedal width in cm.",
  "Iris species."
)
iris_schema$fields <- purrr::imap(
  iris_schema$fields,
  ~ c(.x, description = descriptions[.y])
)
```

Do the authors think that it is possible to create a function to add
descriptions to the schema, in a way that is used in a similar way as
the other functions of the package? Example of the idea:

``` r
iris_schema <- create_schema(iris) |>
  add_description(
    c(
      "Sepal length in cm.",
      "Sepal width in cm.",
      "Pedal length in cm.",
      "Pedal width in cm.",
      "Iris species."
    )
  )
```

-   The vignette says that in order to validate the Data Package, the
    users need to use Python. Is there any plans to implement that
    funcionality in R aswell?
