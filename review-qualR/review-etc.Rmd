### Questions on the reviewer guide

- Does the code comply with general principles in the [Mozilla reviewing guide](https://mozillascience.github.io/codeReview/review.html)?

- Does the package comply with the [rOpenSci packaging guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#building)?

- Are there improvements that could be made to the code style?

- Is there code duplication in the package that should be reduced?

- Are there user interface improvements that could be made?

- Are there performance improvements that could be made?

- Is the documentation (installation instructions/vignettes/examples/demos) 
clear and sufficient? Does it use the principle of multiple points of entry i.e. takes into account the fact that any piece of documentation may be the first encounter the user has with the package and/or the tool/data it wraps?

- Were functions and arguments named to work together to form a common, logical programming API that is easy to read, and autocomplete?

- If you have your own relevant data/problem, work through it with the package. You may find rough edges and use-cases the author didn’t think about.

## Checks

We encourage you to use automated tools to facilitate your reviewing. These include:

- Checking the package’s logs on its continuous integration services (GitHub Actions, Codecov, etc.)

- Running devtools::check() and devtools::test() on the package to find any errors that may be missed on the author’s system.


- Seeing whether tests’ skipping is justified (e.g. skip_on_cran() tests that do real API requests vs. skipping all tests on one operating system).
