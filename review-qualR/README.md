## Test installation

### test local `qualR` install:

``` r
install(pkg_dir, dependencies = T, build_vignettes = T)
```

``` r
remove.packages("qualR")
```

#### **comments:**

The local installation worked. ✨

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### test install of `qualR` from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("quishqa/qualR", dependencies = T, build_vignettes = T)
```

#### **comments:**

The installation via GitHub worked. ✨

## Check package integrity

### run checks on `qualR` source:

``` r
devtools::check(pkg_dir)
```

**Check results:**

    ── R CMD check results ─────────────────────────────── qualR 0.9.5 ────
    Duration: 1m 54s

    > checking R/sysdata.rda ... OK

        ‘usp_o3_aug21.png’

    0 errors ✓ | 1 warning x | 1 note x

#### **comments:**

The check returned 1 note and 1 warning.

About the warning:

The warning of qpdf is related to an external program. In this
Stackoverflow answer there is an explanation for it:
<https://stackoverflow.com/a/44649267>

About the note:

There are some files that are not needed to the package be build, so it
needs to be ignored on `.Rbuildignore` . One way to do that is to use
`usethis::use_build_ignore("relative_path_to_the_file)`. But I do not
recommend to use this function to all the files that the Check listed.
There are some files that would be better located in other directories,
not in the root of the package (such as the images and the files related
to the paper being written about the package). In this link, there is
more information about the `.Rbuildignore` file:
<https://r-pkgs.org/package-structure-state.html#rbuildignore>  
Ex:

    > usethis::use_build_ignore("CONTRIBUTING.md")
    ✓ Setting active project to '/home/bea/GitHub/ropensci_reviews/qualR'
    ✓ Adding '^CONTRIBUTING\\.md$' to '.Rbuildignore'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### run tests on `qualR` source:

``` r
devtools::test(pkg_dir)
```

**Tests results:**

    ══ Results ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    Duration: 71.1 s

    [ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 8 ]

#### **comments:**

All the tests passed. There are only a few tests. I recommend the
authors to write more expectations with `expect_*()`.

There is a test are not testing anything related to the package: In
`test-CetesbRetrieveParam.R`, the only expectation is
`expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)`. You can check here:
<https://github.com/quishqa/qualR/blob/dc15bd0d95366fad17258749890a0840b996b38b/tests/testthat/test-CetesbRetrieveParam.R#L15>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### check `qualR` for goodpractice:

``` r
goodpractice::gp(pkg_dir)
```

    ── GP qualR ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It is good practice to

      ✖ avoid calling setwd(), it changes the global
        environment. If you need it, consider using on.exit() to
        restore the working directory.

        may want to clean up by 'rm -Rf
        /tmp/RtmpNm3vzd/Rd2pdf3bab53f279cd'

#### **comments:**

I recommend that the authors check if the `setwd()` is really necessary.
The r-pkgs.org book says that `setwd()` should be used with caution.
[Reference](https://r-pkgs.org/r.html#code-r-landscape).

-   Please review the bagdes in the README.
    -   There is two badges, the one for Travis has a broken link (404).
    -   Add rOpenSci Review badge:

-   Code of conduct: in the book, is recommended to use a code of
    conduct (CoC), and I did not find that information in the README.
    You can create that using `usethis`. But it is important to read
    this link:
    <https://devguide.ropensci.org/collaboration.html#coc-file> which
    says that if the package is transfered to rOpenSci GitHub
    organization, the CoC that needs to be used is the CoC that ropensci
    uses.

## Notes related to the book ‘rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review’

## Datasets inside the package

The file `R/sysdata.rda` is storing some datasets of the package.
Accordingly to [r-pkgs](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html?q=r/#data-sysdata),
`R/sysdata.rda` should be used to internal datasets. Since the datasets
are meant to be used by the users (some of them are on the README), it
would be good to check if all the datasets that are meant to be used by
the users are stored in the `data/` directory .

To store the dataset in `data/`, you can use:

    > usethis::use_data(cetesb)
    ✓ Saving 'cetesb' to 'data/cetesb.rda'
    • Document your data (see 'https://r-pkgs.org/data.html')

## Console messages

It is not recommended to use `cat()` to communicate with the user of the
functions.
[Reference](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#console-messages)

## CITATION file

The CITATION file exists. There are releases on GitHUb, but I did not
find any reference to Zenodo.
[Reference](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#citation-file).
There is 0 results searching for qualR on Zenodo:
<https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=qualR> . Read more how to do
it and have a DOI for your package on [the GitHub
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Questions on the reviewer guide

-   Does the code comply with general principles in the [Mozilla
    reviewing
    guide](https://mozillascience.github.io/codeReview/review.html)?

-   Does the package comply with the [rOpenSci packaging
    guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#building)?

-   Are there improvements that could be made to the code style?

-   Is there code duplication in the package that should be reduced?

-   Are there user interface improvements that could be made?

-   Are there performance improvements that could be made?

-   Is the documentation (installation
    instructions/vignettes/examples/demos) clear and sufficient? Does it
    use the principle of multiple points of entry i.e. takes into
    account the fact that any piece of documentation may be the first
    encounter the user has with the package and/or the tool/data it
    wraps?

-   Were functions and arguments named to work together to form a
    common, logical programming API that is easy to read, and
    autocomplete?

-   If you have your own relevant data/problem, work through it with the
    package. You may find rough edges and use-cases the author didn’t
    think about.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Checks

We encourage you to use automated tools to facilitate your reviewing.
These include:

-   Checking the package’s logs on its continuous integration services
    (GitHub Actions, Codecov, etc.)

-   Running devtools::check() and devtools::test() on the package to
    find any errors that may be missed on the author’s system.

-   Seeing whether tests’ skipping is justified (e.g. skip_on_cran()
    tests that do real API requests vs. skipping all tests on one
    operating system).
